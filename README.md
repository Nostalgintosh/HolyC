# HolyC Technical Research & Reverse-Engineering

## Project Overview
This repository is a personal knowledge base dedicated to the study, dissection, and reverse-engineering of the **HolyC** programming language. HolyC is a unique C-variant used in TempleOS, featuring Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and non-standard syntax.

## Purpose & Ethics
* **Academic Focus:** This project is a strictly technical study of legacy software architecture.
* **Non-Affiliation:** The maintainer is not affiliated with the original creator, Terry A. Davis. 
* **Disclaimer:** While I acknowledge the technical complexity of this language, I do not endorse or share the personal views, opinions, or ideologies expressed by its creator. 
* **Community Note:** This repo exists to preserve the "code logic" for educational purposes, separate from the history of the individual.

## What I'm Learning (Reverse-Engineering Progress)
- [ ] Understanding I64 vs standard int types.
- [ ] Mapping JIT function calls.
- [ ] Memory allocation quirks in a ring-0 environment.
